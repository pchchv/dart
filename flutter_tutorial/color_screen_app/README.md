# color_screen_app

### Challenge from [Flutter Tutorial](https://flutter-tutorial.net/navigation-in-flutter/return-data-from-screen-in-flutter/):
Create a app with a HomeScreen and a ColorSelectionScreen. The HomeScreen should have a button to navigate to the ColorSelectionScreen where the user can select a color. Once a color is selected, the ColorSelectionScreen should return that color to the HomeScreen, which then changes its background color accordingly.
