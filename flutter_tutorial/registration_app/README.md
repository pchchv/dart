### Practice from [Flutter Tutorial](https://flutter-tutorial.net/useful-widgets/questions-for-practice-4/):
Design a form with validation that includes fields for user registration: username, password, confirm password, and email. Display appropriate error messages for invalid inputs. Construct a dynamic form in Flutter that adds a new text field every time the user presses an ‘Add’ button. Include a ‘Submit’ button to display all entered data in a dialog box.
