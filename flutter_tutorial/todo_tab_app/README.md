# todo_tab_app

### Challenge from [Flutter Tutorial](https://flutter-tutorial.net/navigation-in-flutter/tab-bar-in-flutter/):
Look at the example 2 and add trailing icons to move tasks between tabs. For example, when you tap on the trailing icon of a task in the Active tab, it should move to the Completed tab. Similarly, when you tap on the trailing icon of a task in the Completed tab, it should move to the Active tab.
